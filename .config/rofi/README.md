##  :file_folder: How i made.
- I like dracula theme just like any other coder, so i decided to take their config of rofi.
- but, that was not that much cool, or should i say, i didn't liked it.
- So i start modifying it the way i like, since it's super easy it's just CSS (kind of).
- Original Theme: https://draculatheme.com/rofi
